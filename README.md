The inverted pendulum on a cart is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory, and is used as a way to explain optimal control, space state equations, linearization of non dynamical equation, etc.

In this project, the non linear dynamics are going to be linearized, the optimal control system is going to be created using the linear system of equations and it is going to be simulated as a feedback control model in Simulink.
